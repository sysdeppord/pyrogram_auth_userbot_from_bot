# pyrogram_auth_userbot_from_bot
example
This is an example of code that allows you to authorize a Telegram userbot to a user account with the help of another bot.

I immediately apologize for the stupid code, I only recently started fully learning Python, so I wrote as I wrote, the main thing is that it works)

IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER!
If authorization is carried out in the account from which authorization is carried out through a regular bot (that is, the userbot connects to the account from which authorization is carried out), then the login confirmation code must be sent with at least one space, otherwise Telegram immediately cancels it! (for this, message conversion is provided with the removal of spaces on the 66th line of the code)
